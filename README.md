# Eat-Da-Burger
This is a JavaScript app with an Express.js server, MYSQL database, and Handlebars templating engine where a user can add burgers to a list of burgers waiting to be eaten, then eat those burgers, pushing them to the other side of the page.

Use the app by:

* following this link to the deployed heroku project: https://vast-plateau-30570.herokuapp.com/
* entering a new burger in the "Add burger" form. This will insert a burger into the database. 
* Clicking the "devour" button to watch a burger move to the other side of the list (this updates the database).
