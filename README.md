# Eat-Da-Burger
This is an app where you can add burgers to a list of burgers waiting to be eaten, then eat those burgers, pushing them to the other side of the page. The back-end for the app is in Node.js utilizing Express. The database is a MySQL database, ensuring that burger data persists. Additionally, the front-end is handled through the handlebars templating system. 

Use the app by:

* entering a new burger in the "Add burger" form. This will insert a burger into the database. 
* Clicking the "devour" button to watch a burger move to the other side of the list (this updates the database).
